> 💯 The technical test is the equivalent of user story.

## **💡 Context**

In POKE-1, the infinite list was implemented. We now have the `Pokemons` page, with all Pokemons listed. Not a lot of information is available though, so we need a screen to list the details of a Pokemon.

## **✅ Acceptance criteria**

### Header

> 💡 You may or may not need to change the `PageContainer` component

- We need to see the image of the Pokemon.
    - When scroll is at 0, the image is centered and takes ~25% of the screen height.
    - When scrolling, it gradually (with an animation) moves to the top right to be ~32x32.
- The name of the Pokemon should be at the top center of the header, no animations.

### Content

- The content of the page should contain three sections:
    1. The types of the Pokemon
    2. The first 5 moves of the Pokemon
    3. The Pokemon evolutions
        - They should be pressable, and by pressing them we should navigate to the details screen of this Pokemon.

## ℹ️ Additional information

- Loading states are up to you
- Architecture is up to you
- File structure is up to you
- Libraries used are up to you

## 💻 Technical details

- For image:
    - use the `front_default` image from the `sprites` attributes on `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}`
- For type:
    - `types` attribute on `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}`
- For moves
    - `moves` attribute on `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}`
- For evolutions
    - Fetch the `pokemon-species` from `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/${id}`
    - Fetch the according `evolution_chain.url`
    - The result is a nested `chain` of evolutions
        - Get the id from the `species.url` and the name to build the evolution’s UI card
        - Filter out the Pokemon that is currently displayed

## Get started

### Start Android Simulator
Failed to resolve the Android SDK path. Default install location not found: /Users/julie/Library/Android/sdk. Use ANDROID_HOME to set the Android SDK location.

### Start IOS simulator
First make sure you have Xcode and the xocode dev tools install. You might need to run this:
```angular2html
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
Then make sure you have available simulator: 
```angular2html
xcrun simctl list devices
```
If the list is empty, go into XCode -> window -> device and simulators -> simulators  and click '+'  to add a new simulator.
